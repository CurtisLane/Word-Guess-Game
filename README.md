# Word-Guess-Game
A word guessing game similar to hangman built with JavaScript.

Functions:
  1. A random word is chosen when the page loads. Underscores appear on the page indicating the number of letters in the word.
  2. Begin by pressing any letter on your keyboard to make a guess. The current message (in red) will disappear.
  3. When you guess correctly, your letter will replace one of the underscores below the "Current Word" heading.
  4. If you make an incorrect guess, the letter will appear below the "Wrong Guesses" header and a Dragon Ball will disappear!
  5. You can not guess the same letter twice.
  6. If you guess all of the letters before running out of all 7 Dragon Balls, a message will appear, 1 will be added to the number below the "Wins" header, and any Dragon Balls you lost will reappear!
  7. If you guess incorrectly 7 times, a message will display and the game will stop. Pressing the space bar after losing will refresh the page bringing your wins back to zero.
